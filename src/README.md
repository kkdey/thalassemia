# thalassemia

This is a meta analysis project I am part along with Avash Das and Soheir S. Adam. The core idea of this project is 
to take multiple meta analysis studies of Overall Survival (OS), Disease free survival (DFS) and Engraftment for 
different stem cell transplant mechanisms (MRD, MUD, MSD, PBHSC and UCBHSC). The details of the experiment are 
provided in the "thalassemia and tranasplant" file.
